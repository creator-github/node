# Node.JS

How to launch test server:

1 step. 
Clone repository from GitHub to your folder using the command "git clone https://github.com/creator-github/node.git" into the command prompt.

2 step. (optional) 
Usually you need to install all dependencies of the project, but in this case I used
only "nodemon" in my project, so it is not important.
You can install all dependencies using the command "npm install".

3 step.
Write the command "npm start" into the command prompt.
You will see such text:

"
npm start

> home-work-29@1.0.0 start
> node file.js

Server started

"
4 step.
Now you can open your browser and write in the browser address bar - "http://localhost:3000/".
